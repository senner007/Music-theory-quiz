## Music theory mastery
This is currently under development.

### Introduction:
Train your ears to recognize melodic and harmonic patterns with ear training and theory exercises. Develop your ability to distinguish different musical elements, enhancing your improvisational skills and enabling you to play by ear with greater accuracy and fluency.

### Philosophy
Learn to audiate musical elements, structures, pitches and harmony without using an instrument. 
Hear the diatonic relationships and learn to reproduce it in your mind.

### Contents so far:
- Hear the missing 12th tone
- Hear scales
- Hear tetrachord
- Hear trichord pitch patterns
- Name the missing scale note
- Name the scale degree note
- Audiate bass lines
- Audiate contextual intervals
- Audiate functional solfege degrees
- Audiate harmonic progressions (with generic patterns)
- Name the triad type
